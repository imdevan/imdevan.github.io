The intent behind Background for Inbox was to add a touch of personal detail to
an otherwise amazing
email client, <a class="base--a" href="http://inbox.google.com">Google Inbox</a>.

The extension only runs when a user goes to
<a class="base--a" href="http://inbox.google.com">http://inbox.google.com</a>.

This project was the second or third chrome extension I have made and it utilizes
javascript that is injected onto the email client's page to change the background
style to either a color, gradient, or image.

Images and color styles are saved to the google chrome's local storage api and are
synced across different devices.
