title: "Background for Inbox"

Background for inbox was made to fill the proverbial and literal whitespace
of <a class="base--a" href="http://inbox.google.com">Google Inbox</a>.

At it's core it uses javascript to set the background of the div behind emails on the inbox.google.com page.

What I like about this project is that it demonstrates the capacity to see something that could be improved on and be adopted by thousands of people.
