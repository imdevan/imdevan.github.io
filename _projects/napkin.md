Napkin is a project that I'm working on as with some friends in the austin area. On the project I've worn a few hats in the short amount of time that I've spent on the project.

I've mostly helped with delivering design guidance, as well as helping the team get traction. Only one of the members of the team has experience with software development, so I've been helping them through the forming stages of the project.

<a class="base--a" href="http://napkin.life">Napkin</a> is still a very young project, but I'm excited to see where the team takes it.
