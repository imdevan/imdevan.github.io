        Pebble timer
    </span>
</a> was a project that I created using <a href="https://cloudpebble.net/">
CloudPebble</a> for my Pebble smart watch.

The app is a basic timer that you can set an interval where your Pebble
watch would vibrate at. So that if you were say, giving a ten minute long talk
you could set your watch to vibrate after evert two minutes to help pace yourself,
or as a workout interval timer.

The app was created using Pebble's apis and C.
