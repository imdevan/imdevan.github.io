        Word Swap
    </span>
</a> was the first chrome extension that I worked on. The extension allows a user
to set a pre-defined list of words in the options page for the extension, and when
the user goes to a webpage that contains any of the words they set, the word is
replaced with another word that they chose.

The extension injected javascript on the page to traverse all of the text on page
load and swapped out any text that matched a particular pattern.
