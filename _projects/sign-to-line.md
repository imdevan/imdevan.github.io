Sign to line was created over a weekend at GeauxHack, a hackathon held at LSU
in Baton Rouge Louisiana.

The idea for the project came from one of my teammates on the project who was
getting their undergraduate degree in Biology. She saw that there was no affordable
solution in the marketplace for translating American Sign Language to readable text.

We spent the weekend using a <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" class="base--a">
    <span class="project--external-link">
        Leap Motion Controller
    </span>
</a> we analyzed tracked signed words and transcribed the signed words into a web
browser.

While at the competition our team took home first place.
