Pan diversity was created at a hackathon in Austin Texas to promote diversity, by
providing users with an aggregated list of diversity in the news via a new tab
extension in the same vein as the Panada app.

I created this project with a team of 4, on the project I created the front end
architecture and set up Kimono's web scraping api to collect data from different
websites such as Huffington Post, Harvard Business, and many more.
