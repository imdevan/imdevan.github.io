So I'm working on a swift app, and so far the experience has been awful.

The primary cause of this terrible experience. THE DOCS!

I didn't think that it could be possible for such a popular programming language
to have such terrible docs!

Coming from building for the web where it is hard to not find docs on common problems,
I felt the complete opposite when it came to building with Swift.

Maybe it's that its my first app! Who knows?

I can say that the dependency management seems much worse for Swift and having
to use Xcode which follows about 0% of standards followed by IDE's in regards to
standard hotkeys and autocomplete.

I shouldn't have to search three hours to find the equivalent of

```js
var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(button)
```

Which I still haven't found, and I'm beginning to think does not exist! ðŸ˜±


### Final thoughts

3/10 would not recommend building with swift (or objective-c), but you don't
have a choice if you want to build a thing that runs well on osX so good luck ðŸ™ƒ
