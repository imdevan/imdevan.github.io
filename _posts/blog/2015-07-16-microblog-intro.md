A µblog is a blog with moderately short blog postings. Longer than facebook status' shorter than a medium blog. The µblog!

#### UX considerations for the µblog: 
- The µblog should be relatively short, no longer than 5 pages (at this point it is already basically a regular blog, but I'm willing to make some exceptions for solid posts).
- All of the blog & up to 4 comments can live on the home page. 
- Clicking the blog will take reader to the full page view, with more comments
