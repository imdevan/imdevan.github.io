While at OSCON this week I was able to demo the Go programming language.

I could have done this whenever and I encourage you to do the same, a link to the
talk can be found here. http://www.slideshare.net/spf13

The purpose of the talk was to develop command line applications. The talk was
given by the creator of [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) which is a great
library for building command line applications with Go. It basically takes care
of a lot of boiler plate which is awesome, and takes the thinking about how to
go about writing a cli app, which (as I learned) is the point of Go. I think
I like this language a lot.

I plan on using the library to create a cli app that our designers can use to
effectively use git and run our application.
