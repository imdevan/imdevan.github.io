## Are you hydrated?
If not, have a glass of water.

## Have you eaten in the past three hours?
If not, get some food. Something with protein, not simple carbs. Perhaps nuts or
 yogurt?

## Have you showered in the past day?
If not, take a shower right now.

## Have you stretched your legs in the past day?
If not, do so right now. If you don't have the energy for a run or a trip to
the gym, walk around the block, then keep walking as long as you please.

## Have you said something nice to someone in the past day?
If not, do so, whether online or in person. Make it genuine; wait until you see something really wonderful about someone, and tell them about it.

## Have you moved your body to music in the past day?
If not, jog to the length of an EDM song at your favorite tempo, or just dance
around the room for the length of an upbeat song.

## Have you hugged a living being in the past two days?
If not, do so. Don't be afraid to ask for hugs from friends or friends' pets.
Most of them will enjoy the hug too.

## Have you sought out mentorship or guidance in the past few days?
If not, do so. You'll have a better perspective of what you're working on or how
you feel if you explain it to someone else, and you'll get good feedback.

## Have you taken your vitamins?
If not, do so. That may be making you feel tired and lazy.

## If daytime: are you dressed?
If not, put on clean clothes that aren't pajamas. Give yourself permission to
wear something special, whether it's a funny t-shirt or a nice button down.

## If nighttime: are you sleepy and fatigued but resisting to go to sleep?
Put on pajamas, brush your teeth, take a shower, make yourself cozy in bed with
a teddy bear and the sound of falling rain, and close your eyes for fifteen
minutes - no electronic screens allowed. If you're still awake after that, you
can get up again; no pressure. Or, read a book.

## Do you feel ineffective?
Pause right now and get something small completed, whether it's responding to an
email, loading up the dishwasher, or packing your gym bag for your next trip.
Good job!

## Do you feel unattractive?
Go for a run! You most likely feel that way because you feel like unhealthy.

## Do you feel paralyzed by indecision?
Give yourself ten minutes to sit back and figure out a game plan for the day. If
a particular decision or problem is still being a roadblock, simply set it aside
 for now, and pick something else that seems doable. Right now, the important
 part is to break through that stasis, even if it means doing something trivial.

## Have you over-exerted yourself lately; physically, emotionally, socially, or intellectually?
That can take a tool that lingers for days. Give yourself a break that area,
 whether it's physical rest, taking time alone, or relaxing with some silly
 entertainment.

## Have you waited a week?
Some times our perception of life is skewed, and we can't even tell that
we're not thinking clearly, and there's no obvious external cause. It happens.
Keep yourself going for a full week, whatever it takes, and see if you still
feel the same way then.
