# Key take aways

The major takeaway from this book was that action pre-seeds feeling. Don't
wait to feel confident about something. Doing leads to confidence.

Russ Harris also talks about allowing yourself to feel fear. Telling yourself you are not afraid,
or simply feeding yourself positive affirmations do not help you feel more confident.
The problem with positive affirmations is that we tend to feel even worse
when our bodies feel different than our mind's are telling us we should feel.
Instead we should let our mind feel fear. "Okay mind, thanks for that information,"
and then proceed to act according to your values and not our feelings; see
first paragraph.

We are ALWAYS motivated. Even when we are "tired" we are tired due to some motivation.
Life is pain, but we can choose to be lazy and stay where we are in life and suffer
the pain of long term regret and persistent feelings of stagnation, or the pain of short-term discomfort for the sake of moving closer to where we want to be in life.
