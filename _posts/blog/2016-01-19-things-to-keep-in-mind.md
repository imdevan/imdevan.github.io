* Always have a water bottle in your car.
* Carry an extra lighter (even if you don't smoke).
* Get something new where you go to eat often, not just your usual.
* Make a budget for yourself
* But don't forget to give yourself some play money.
* Always round up on how much things cost so you have money left over.
* If you're texting someone, but nervous to send it, just click the fucking send button. You typed out that message for a reason.
* Stay out late, wake up early. You'll be glad you had all of your day.
* When you're talking to someone, and you suddenly think of something you want to say, put up a finger and wait for them to finish talking. It'll help you remember what you wanted to say, but you wont interrupt them.
* Go to plenty of concerts. Especially outdoor ones.
* Get drunk with your friends.
* Always keep a change of clothes in your car.
* Keep at least $20 cash on you at all times times.
* It's okay to be sad.
* If you think something is cute, fucking wear it. Don't worry about what everyone else thinks. You'll look great, I promise.
* Sex stores are fun, even if you just want a good laugh.
* Plan out your days off with your friends that way you aren't stuck asking the "I don't know what do you want to do?"
* Don't forget to remind your friends how much they mean to you.
* If someone gives you a compliment, smile and say thank you. They wouldn't say it, if they didn't mean it.
* Drink plenty of water.
* Wear sunscreen.
* You're allowed to be happy. Don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise.
* Aim to be better, not bitter.
* Some days are better than others.
* You can never over pack. Pack what you want. You'll be glad you have options.
* Take those extra hours at work. It'll be worth it when you see your paycheck.
* Clean your fucking room and make your bed you slob. It'll look much nice and you'll feel better having did it.
* If you have to, make the first move. It's scary, but someone has to do it.
* Take plenty of pictures. Of the sunset, your food, your friends, your dog, selfies. Everything. That way, later when you scroll through your camera roll, you'll remember everything about that day.
