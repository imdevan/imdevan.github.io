This book was pretty darn good.

I felt that this book read somewhat like an essay on *How to Make Friends and
Influence People*. Which I didn't mind one bit. I thought that Leil Lowndes
made valid points based on her work in human centered position as an entertainer,
aboard a cruise ship and various other points in her life and studies she has performed.

The book's full title is <a class="base--a" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Anyone-Success-Relationships/dp/007141858X" target="_blank"><i>How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big
    Success in Relationships</i></a>, which is a bit ridiculous, but if you can look past
that there is some genuinely good advice in this book.

A lot of it could be passed of as "common knowledge" and as with all subjects,
no one should ever take any one book as the source of truth.

### Key take aways

1. Read <i>How to win Friends and Influence People</i>
2. Intentionally practice being friendly, so that you are ready when you need to be
3. Put yourself out there

I would recommend this book üëç
