Yesterday while bouldering I was trying to climb a v5, and half way through the problem my hand slipped on a volume while trying to finagle my foot into the same position my hand was at. It hurt, for a while.

The pain felt good though. It felt good knowing that I was trying something was two grades harder than my average climbing ability, making it halfway up and having the courage to try something I wasn’t sure I could do. When I left ABP that day I was satisfied and proud of myself, I’ll get it next time I go.

I know there is a metaphor in there somewhere... Something about how pushing our boundaries is how we grow as people, and that if we have the courage to try new things we will know what it feels to truly live.

But when I think about how I take that lesson and apply that to other people I tend to fall short. Maybe it is because talking to people is something I don’t have to do on a daily basis, but it has always been something I’ve wanted to improve on.

Maybe people are a problem I haven’t tried yet, really tried.
