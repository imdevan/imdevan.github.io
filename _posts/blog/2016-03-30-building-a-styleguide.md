So, as it would turn out that building a style guide can be super stressful.

On my team at IBM we have decided to build what would ultimately become a guide
for anyone wanting to contribute front-end code to our application.

The purpose of the style guide was to make it easier for designers to contribute
to our production code, and to give the front end developers on our team a
consistent way to write markup and styles that are based on industry
professionals and agrees with our collective philosophy.
