Conferences are basically the life blood of the development world, and I've been
really wanting to get into speaking at conferences.

I saw the deadline for this one was two days away and I thought I could come up
with something, I couldn't. I had too much going and it wasn't going to happen.

So, I'm learning from the mistake and layout out several topics I would like to
be able to give a talk on the next time the chance comes up. I'm going to have those
written out, and have my conference bio down. Hell, I guess I could just have it
as my meta description for this sight, but it could be too long for that.
