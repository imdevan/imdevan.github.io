For me,being optimally productive is a constant struggle.

<!-- more -->

I'm always trying to find a way to capture all of my thoughts in a way that I will be sure to revisit them later. 

Whether it is an idea for a song or an app, I want to make sure that I remember it. The biggest problem that I (used to) have, is having some way to capture those thoughts and ideas. 


### Writting

### Audio Recording

### Weekly Planning

For things that I need to do on a day to day basis I will mark them on my calander at a time that kind of makes sense. It doesn't have to be completely acurate or done at that exact time, but it does give me a reminder to take care of that item in the near future. 

For the longest time I was keeping these items in my backpocket book. However, I stoped doing this because I found that when I did miss something, which happens often it is easier to move it to another day and get the reminder at the next best time I may need to do whatever the task is. 

### ToDo Items That Aren't Date Specific



### Weekly Review

On my calander I have a meeting scheduled for every Sunday at 11am. In the description of this meeting I have a set of tasks to take care of. 

{% highlight ruby %}
Weekly review that consists of the following:

- review back-pocket
- review audio recorder
- review last weekâ€™s calendar

- clear inbox 

- pay credit card
- pay rent (if due)
- pay internet bill (if due)

- clean out backpack
- tidy room

- write about current project you are or have not falied at yet

- Select an activity to monitor in each:
- - Physical
- - Social 
- - Mental
- - Mediation
{% endhighlight %}

I don't always get to everything on the list, but I do make a solid college try.  
If I don't get to the review on Sunday I'll move the item over on my calander until I get it done. 

The description does change as needed, I don't have any sort of religous list of things that I monitor. The important thing is that I do have a review every week.

### Conclusions

The biggest benifit that I find to having a way to capture my ideas, is that it gives me permission to think and create freely. I don't feel that I am constrained to think or do at a specific time or place.
