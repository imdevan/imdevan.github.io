For me,being optimally productive is a constant struggle.

I'm always trying to find the best rythm to capture all of my thoughts in a way that I will be sure to revisit them later.

Whether it is an idea for a song or an app, I want to make sure that I remember it. The biggest problem that I (used to) have, is having some way to capture those thoughts and ideas.


### Writting

I tend to keep about three Moleskine notebooks on me at any point in time.

Two of my notebooks are 5x8 blank (no-lines) cahier notebooks. One of them is for personal projects, ideas, thoughts, drawings, and the other one is for work related stuff. I generally try to keep my work and personal projects seperate so that when I'm at work I don't get distracted with whatever personal projects I'm working on at the time.

The other notebook is a small 3x5 valent notebook, with lines. I always keep this notebook in my backpocket, and refer to it as my "backpocket book". This notebook is for keeping on my at all times in case something comes up in which I don't have either of my other two notebooks on my person, or if I just want to jot down a quick thought.

All of my notebooks are under 100 pages. I prefer very then notebooks because I want to make sure to regularly review them and store those ideas in a perminent place, or act on them if they are actionable. I have found that having a larger notebook can lend notes getting lost or not wanting to seperate work and personal projects. Another benifit of using smaller notebooks is that I don't have to worry about my notebooks getting cluttered or filled with things that I'm not thinking about anymore.

### Audio Recording

On my phone I installed an audio recording app, for moments when I am unable to write in my notebook. For example, when I'm driving for long periods of time and want to ideate on a thought or story. There are other use cases for this, but that is the biggest one that I have found; and I have found myself driving in cars for long periods of time more and more often.

### Weekly Planning

For things that I need to do on a day to day basis I will mark them on my calander at a time that kind of makes sense. It doesn't have to be completely acurate or done at that exact time, but it does give me a reminder to take care of that item in the near future.

For the longest time I was keeping these items in my backpocket book. However, I stoped doing this because I found that when I did miss something, which happens often it is easier to move it to another day and get the reminder at the next best time I may need to do whatever the task is.

### Weekly Review

On my calander I have a meeting scheduled for every Sunday at 11am. In the description of this meeting I have a set of tasks to take care of.

{% highlight ruby %}
Weekly review that consists of the following:

- review back-pocket
- review audio recorder
- review last weekâ€™s calendar

- clear inbox

- pay credit card
- pay rent (if due)
- pay internet bill (if due)

- clean out backpack
- tidy room

- write about current project you are or have not falied at yet

- Select an activity to monitor in each:
- - Physical
- - Social
- - Mental
- - Mediation
{% endhighlight %}

I don't always get to everything on the list, but I do make a solid college try.  
If I don't get to the review on Sunday I'll move the item over on my calander until I get it done.

The description does change as needed, I don't have any sort of religous list of things that I monitor. The important thing is that I do have a review every week.

### Conclusions

The biggest benifit that I find to having a way to capture my ideas, is that it gives me permission to think and create freely. I don't feel that I am constrained to think or do at a specific time or place.
