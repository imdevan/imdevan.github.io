# Personal Thoughts

#### Section 1
So far I'm really liking the book. Actionable take aways include:

- Write more
- Spend several hours thinking of your software development as a business,
what relationships can you come up with?
- Spend several hours thinking about your careers goals and clearly define them.
- Apply the same methods you do to you work, to most things in your life.
- Estimate everything, test, and reflect. see you accurate you can be.
