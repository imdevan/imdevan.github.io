I've started investing in stocks.

For my initial investment I'm attempting to gain 50 dollars from a 1000 dollar
investment. For this to be successful I will need to see a 5% gain. I plan on
achieving this 5% gain over the period of a month by investing in two safe companies.

Currently, I have invested in 2 shares of TSLA at 242 a share and 4 shares of FB
 at 116 a share and WLL at 11.85 a share.

At closing I have made 3.04 which is around .3%. which is equal to roughly 9% a month.
