I've started investing in stocks.

For my initial investment I'm attempting to gain 50 dollars from a 1000 dollar
investment. For this to be successful I will need to see a 5% gain. I plan on
achieving this 5% gain over the period of a month by investing in two safe companies.

Currently, I have invested in 2 shares of TSLA at 242 a share and 4 shares of FB
 at 116 a share and WLL at 11.85 a share.

At closing I have made 3.04 which is around .3%. which is equal to roughly 9% a month.

## Update May 16

So tesla went south... from 484 on Apr 29 to 431 on May 9th. I went to a
pretty sort return in just a few days.

Since then I have sold my WLL stock which also took a turn, but that one I was
expecting to be be risky.

I've sold both stocks, and invested in RHS a S&P ETF and VNQ a REIT ETF; neither
of which have had an overall negative previous week, month, or year. I also
Invested another 1,000 because at this point I think that my expected return is
closer to 14% per year (i.e. 1.16% per month or roughly 11 a month).

So with that in mind and ~ 1954 at time of typing
