# ... At work, mostly

## So I read this book,


It's a good book that my manager sent to me, with a big bright
and shiny star on the front that remembes that of the sort stars
that one would receive in elementry school for having done
some thing that was of not particularly, although still, above,
and somtimes beyond.

Even though to cover is aweful, I decided to infact NOT judge this
book by it's cover and try giving it a read.
