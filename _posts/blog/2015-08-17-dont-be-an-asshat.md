# ... At work, mostly

## So I read this book,


It's a good book that my manager sent to me, with a big bright
and shiny star on the front that remembers that of the sort stars
that one would receive in elementary school for having done
some thing that was of not particularly, although still, above,
and sometimes beyond.

Even though to cover is awful, I decided to in-fact NOT judge this
book by it's cover and try giving it a read.
