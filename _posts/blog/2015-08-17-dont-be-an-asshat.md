## Build a Culture of Engagement

We shouldn't be building an engaging and inclusive culture because we are Hackathon Hackers, 
we should be building an engaging and inclusive culture because it is the right thing to do.

I have seen WAY too many people posting online about about how someone whill shut down someone else's ideas because of x, y, or z. 

As a call to action I ask everyone to explicitely state that they will answer any question, no matter how simple they may seem.

Being good to others opens the doors to a community of people who are happy and will generally make the world a better place.
