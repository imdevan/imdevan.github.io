I found it somewhat difficult to relate to this book due to all of the reference coming from someone who at the beginning of their perspective journey was already immensely wealthy and successful. Although it is hard to gage from just the book itself that she was always wealthy.

## Key Takeaways

1. Intentionally practice relaxation.
2. Meditate regularly.
3. Thinking about death, at least occasionally.
