I enjoyed reading this book, but yes that is the key takeaway. Even though it is completely obvious, it is definitely a well written reminder to always to take time to think about your decisions.

Simon Sinok suggests, and I agree that for any choice you make you should be able to answer the question "Why?" The answer doesn't have to be the wisest one. The answer that is most closely aligned with your values, whatever they are, is the choice that will make you the happiest.

Simon also goes on to highlight several companies and stories in which they did or did not feel in regards to staying aligned with that their core values over time.
