## Log into your Heroku locally

You need to run this to do anything with the Heroku remote server.

{% highlight bash %}
heroku login
{% endhighlight %}

{: .st}
You don't need to login if you are trying to deploy and you have the Heroku app
listening to one of your git branches. More info [below](#deploying-to-heroku).

{: .st}
## Start your app locally

To locally start all of the process types that are defined in your Procfile
{% highlight bash %}
heroku local
{% endhighlight %}

To locally start web process
{% highlight bash %}
heroku local web
{% endhighlight %}

{: .st}
By default Heroku will run `npm install` and `npm start`, but if you want it to
run a different command you can modify your profile, which is a file named
`procfile` in the projects root directory. To contain *only* the process name
you want to modify (web is the default process for deploys).

{% highlight bash %}
# replace `gulp start` with whatever command you want to run
web: gulp start
{% endhighlight %}

{: .st}
## Setting Node environment variable

To locally start all of the process types that are defined in your Procfile
{% highlight bash %}
heroku config:set NODE_ENV=production
{% endhighlight %}

{: .st}
## Deploying to heroku

This images shows a Heroku app that is connected to a Github.com repository.
The Heroku app is set to deploy automatically when the master branch of the
Github repo is updated. So that when someone runs `git push` on the master branch
Heroku will build the app, and replace the current instance with the new one.

This can also cause the Heroku app will break if you push bad code into master,
and that's why we practice good practices such as unit testing, and integration
testing. ðŸ™‚

When you have your Heroku app paired with a Github repository you can run the
following to deploy

{% highlight bash %}
git push
{% endhighlight %}

{: .st}
**Or** if you want to deploy from the
command line w/o connecting your Heroku app to a Github repo you can run.
{% highlight bash %}
# Create new Heroku remote
heroku create
# Push to Heroku remote
git push heroku master
{% endhighlight %}

{: .st}
This will generate a new heroku app and deploy to it.
{: .s}
