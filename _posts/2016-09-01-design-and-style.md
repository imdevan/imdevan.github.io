For my personal site, <span class="text--gray">the one you're on currently</span>. I thought it would be a good
idea to start with a basic style sheet for this website because I really wanted
it to have a strong blogging component, and if I can get down the styling for my
typography, as well as basic page layouts[^1] than I could derive a feel for how I would
want to style the rest of my project.

[^1]: |
    Layouts in this case refer to a format for managing images floating,
    having text next to images in more than one fashion, and aligning text.  

My master plan didn't pan out quite as well as I would have liked, but I did notice that
creating this Style/Bare-bones-css[^2] guide, I learned some useful things for creating
blog posts that leveraged components of the functional css I'm using on the rest of my project.

[^2]: Styling just the tags (e.g h1, p, img)

What you see following is an existing and always updating reference for how I'm styling
(at a minimum the typography, buttons, images, quotes, and code) the experience that is
this website. So far I think it's been useful for being documentation on how the site should
look and feel, and how to do anything in markdown.

## Some things I learned
With [Jekyll](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Jekyll)  using the [kramdown](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=kramdown) the way that you can add classes ontop of the default tags that markdown generates you can use the format

{% highlight ruby %}
Spooky ghost!
{: .text--center .text--purple .text--lg}
{% endhighlight %}

üëá
{: .text--center .text--lg }

üëá
{: .text--center .text--lg }

üëá
{: .text--center .text--lg }

Spooky ghost!
{: .text--center .text--purple .text--lg}

**Note:** I am using `{: .br}` for breaks in section gaps throughout this page.
And `{: .text--center}` for any centered text or images.
{: .br}

I learned that foot notes are really easy to make using `[^<num>]` and can look pretty cool

{% highlight ruby %}
...layouts[^1].
<!-- Leave a blank line or double space after first line -->
[^1]: Layouts in this case refer to
{% endhighlight %}

I don't know if I have perfect use for it just yet, but it's a nice util to know.

## Code

echo "code"
{% endhighlight %}

`echo code`

**Note:** `{: .br}` doesn't work immediately following a `endhighlight`
 so I'm using in instances where a codeblock is the last bit of a section.

Also, apprently you can't put ruby tags inside of inline blocks :/
