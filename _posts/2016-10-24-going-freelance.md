Today is my first day working as a freelance developer.

I've worked at IBM for a year, before than I was a Computer Engineering Student at Texas A&M.

Before that I was going to high school at Sandra Day O'Connor in San Antonio,
Texas. I can't say much happened before then, but I grew up a middle class kid
in North Carolina, then  Germany, then a lot of living in Texas.

I plan to continue this series for the first two months of my practice. If
everything goes well, I'll keep up freelancing.

If it doesn't I'll start applying for jobs as a mid / senior javascript engineer.

Today was my first day. I cleaned out the apartment, and set up my desk.

## No perfect timing

The switch to Freelance is coming as the same time and was somewhat prompted by
another significant time in my life. I'm also leaving my comfortable job at IBM
in Austin, and moving to Dallas to live with my girlfriend of four years.

Any references to "we" or "our" refer to myself and girlfriend.

I have some money saved up. Roughly 10k, but the goal of this experiment is to be
able to not have to expend all of my savings in the process.

## No clients

Right now, I have no clients on retainer.

## The exit strategy

I am giving myself two months to make five thousand dollars in freelancing.

If I am unsuccessful in that en devour I will accept that I will not be able to
sustain a lifestyle similar to my previous one and will evaluate if I should
continue freelancing or if I should look for work else where.

## The business plan

My business plan is to find clients, preferably early stage startups to work
with, and build dynamic web applications with React and Node. Essentially doing
the same work that I was doing at IBM but in a freelance way.

In addition to building a freelance portfolio I aim to build small projects in
order to build further tech savvy, and visibility. When I have an idea that I would
like to build into a true startup itself I plan to leverage the skills I've
built up over the years to execute on it.

## The first day

Because I plan on working from home, and just moved into a new apartment it is
super important to get my home office set up, and my living space organized for
optimal productivity.

I was able to clean out all of our moving boxes, and reduced all of the unpacked
things to go into a small stack ready for our bookshelf once we get one.
