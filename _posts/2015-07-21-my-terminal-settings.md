For the past year I've been developing web applications with Node on OSX.

Once since leaving IBM I am working on a Yoga 2 Pro with Ubuntu installed.

The terminal application I use is [Hyper Term](https://hyper.is/). My editor of
choice is [Atom](http://atom.io). I do like using Vim and will likely have a follow up
article on vim settings.

## Atom

Atom is a text editor made using Github's [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/),
which was originally made for Atom and has since been adopted to be used with
lots of applications. The reason I originally switched to Atom from Sublime text
was because I could drag and drop between folders. I've stuck with it because
I like the plugin ecosystem, and that it has a package manager very similar to
npm, [apm](https://github.com/atom/apm).

### Atom Plugins

- [editor config](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig)
- [emmet](https://atom.io/packages/emmet)
- [merge-conflicts](https://atom.io/packages/merge-conflicts)

### Atom Theme

- One Dark *UI Theme*
- One Dark *Syntax Theme*

# Zsh

[Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) is a shell that is very similar to bash. You see a common
trend here, but the reason I like zsh is because of its plugin ecosystem.

These are the plugins that I use.

### Zsh Plugins

- git
- dirhistory
- sublime
- web-search
- copyfile
- copydir
- cp
- dirpresist
- nvm
- brew
- themes

### Zsh Theme

## Dotfiles  

I started playing with [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) a few
months ago. The result has been a handy tool box that I can clone into any
environment.

My dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/imdevan/dotfiles).
