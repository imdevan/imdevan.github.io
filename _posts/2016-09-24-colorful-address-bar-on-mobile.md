This is what I do for my site using Jekyll, which generates templates for
everypage, so that `#50C0E1` is different depending on the page the user
goes to.

{% highlight html %}
<meta name="theme-color" content="#50C0E1" />
{% endhighlight %}

I think it is a useful trick, especially because I have different pages that I
want to convey a different feeling, and utilizing updated browser techniques
this is one little thing that can make a pretty big impact.

If you want to experiment on your site, you can put your webpages primary color
where you see `content="#50C0E1"` replacing the `#50C0E1` with you're
site's.
