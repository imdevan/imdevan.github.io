        <p>For me,being optimally productive is a constant&nbsp;struggle.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm always trying to find the best rhythm to capture all of my thoughts in a way that I will be sure to revisit them&nbsp;later.</p>

<p>Whether it is an idea for a song or an app, I want to make sure that I remember it. The biggest problem that I (used to) have, is having some way to capture those thoughts and&nbsp;ideas.</p>

<h2 id="writting">Writting</h2>

<p>I tend to keep about three Moleskine notebooks on me at any point in&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>Two of my notebooks are 5x8 blank (no-lines) cahier notebooks. One of them is for personal projects, ideas, thoughts, drawings, and the other one is for work related stuff. I generally try to keep my work and personal projects separate so that when I‚Äôm at work I don‚Äôt get distracted with whatever personal projects I‚Äôm working on at the&nbsp;time.</p>

<p>The other notebook is a small 3x5 valent notebook, with lines. I always keep this notebook in my backpocket, and refer to it as my ‚Äúback pocket book‚Äù. This notebook is for keeping on my at all times in case something comes up in which I don‚Äôt have either of my other two notebooks on my person, or if I just want to jot down a quick&nbsp;thought.</p>

<p>All of my notebooks are under 100 pages. I prefer very thin notebooks because I want to make sure to regularly review them and store those ideas in a permanent place, or act on them if they are actionable. I have found that having a larger notebook can lend notes getting lost or not wanting to separate work and personal projects. Another benefit of using smaller notebooks is that I don‚Äôt have to worry about my notebooks getting cluttered or filled with things that I‚Äôm not thinking about&nbsp;anymore.</p>

<h2 id="audio-recordings">Audio&nbsp;Recordings</h2>

<p>On my phone I installed an audio recording app, for moments when I am unable to write in my notebook. For example, when I‚Äôm driving for long periods of time and want to ideate on a thought or story. There are other use cases for this, but that is the biggest one that I have found; and I have found myself driving in cars for long periods of time more and more&nbsp;often.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-planning">Weekly&nbsp;Planning</h2>

<p>For things that I need to do on a day to day basis I will mark them on my calendar at a time that kind of makes sense. It doesn‚Äôt have to be completely accurate or done at that exact time, but it does give me a reminder to take care of that item in the near&nbsp;future.</p>

<p>For the longest time I was keeping these items in my backpocket book. However, I stopped doing this because I found that when I did miss something, which happens often it is easier to move it to another day and get the reminder at the next best time I may need to do whatever the task&nbsp;is.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-review">Weekly&nbsp;Review</h2>

<p>On my calendar I have a meeting scheduled for every Sunday at 11am. In the description of this meeting I have a set of tasks to take care&nbsp;of.</p>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>`bash
Weekly review that consists of the&nbsp;following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>review&nbsp;back-pocket</li>
  <li>review audio&nbsp;recorder</li>
  <li>
    <p>review last week‚Äôs&nbsp;calendar</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clear&nbsp;inbox</p>
  </li>
  <li>pay credit&nbsp;card</li>
  <li>pay rent (if&nbsp;due)</li>
  <li>
    <p>pay internet bill (if&nbsp;due)</p>
  </li>
  <li>clean out&nbsp;backpack</li>
  <li>
    <p>tidy&nbsp;room</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>write about current project you are or have not failed at&nbsp;yet</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select an activity to monitor in&nbsp;each:</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Social</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Mental</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Mediation&nbsp;&#8220;`</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I don‚Äôt always get to everything on the list, but I do make a solid college try.<br />
If I don‚Äôt get to the review on Sunday I‚Äôll move the item over on my calendar until I get it&nbsp;done.</p>

<p>The description does change as needed, I don‚Äôt have any sort of religious list of things that I monitor. The important thing is that I do have a review every&nbsp;week.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The biggest benefit that I find to having a way to capture my ideas, is that it gives me permission to think and create freely. I don‚Äôt feel that I am constrained to think or do at a specific time or&nbsp;place.</p>
