So I'm building an app. I have thee logo, I have a vague idea of the desig.

I have a ton of paper sketches and I'm the only person on the project. I'm
comfortable designing in browser for this project.

The project has 4 views

1. Gradient with image
2. Gradient without image
3. No Gradient present
4. Info Pages

There will be user information stored (other than analytics).

## In-line styling

{% highlight javascript %}
var styles={
  container: {
    border: '1px solid blue',
  },
  button: {
    background: '5890ff',
  },
};

<div style="{styles.container}"
{% endhighlight %}

## Global styles

## Using a framework?

### Needs to have

### Should I make my own?

## Moving forward
