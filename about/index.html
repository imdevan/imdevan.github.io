        - I like cats, I want to be your friend and talk about design and stuff
    - header: Also,
      text: 
        - I currently work at IBM Design, live in Austin, TX. 
        - I think that rats make for really cute and very inteligent pets. Ironically enough I draw a lot of cat doodles. I like to play board games and card games based on roleplaying games.
        - I thought that I would try building this website without a navigation menu, so I hope that doesn't inconvience you. 
        - You're really great and I'm glad that you've read this far. I'll share a secret with you. If you type "telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl" in your terminal, without quotes, you can watch the original starwars movie in your terminal, which I think is pretty cool.
