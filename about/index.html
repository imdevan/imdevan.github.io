      text:
        - I currently work at IBM Design, live in Austin, TX.
        - I think that rats make for really cute and very inteligent pets. Ironically enough, I draw a lot of cat doodles. I am the offical unoffical cat doodler for the Whitewater UX Team at IBM.
        - I thought that I would try building this website without a navigation menu, so I hope that doesn't inconvience you.
        - You're really great and I'm glad that you've read this far. I'll share a secret with you. If you type "telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl" in your terminal, without quotes, you can watch the original starwars movie in your terminal, which I think is pretty cool.
