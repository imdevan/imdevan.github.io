      color: seafoam
      text:
        - I currently work at IBM Design, live in Austin, TX.
        - I think that rats make for really cute and very inteligent pets. Ironically enough I draw a lot of cat doodles. I like to play board games and card games based on roleplaying games.
        - I thought that I would try building this website without a navigation menu, so I hope that doesn't inconvience you.
        - You're really great and I'm glad that you've read this far. I'll share a secret with you. If you type "telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl" in your terminal, without quotes, you can watch the original starwars movie in your terminal, which I think is pretty cool.
        - My favorite presets on my bp50 multi-effect bass pedel are 64, 32, 31, 4, & 5
